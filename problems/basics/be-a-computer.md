# Be-a-Computer: Programming Basics

In the following exercises, you will be shown a piece of code, and will have to figure out what it does (without running it yourself in the Python interpreter)

## Exercise #1

What is the value of `w` after evaluating the following code?
Answer = 11.75

    x = 7
    y = 5.0
    z = 10.0
    w = x % 2 + y / z + z + y / (z + z)

## Exercise #2

What is the value of `c` after evaluating the following code?
Answer = True

    c = True
    d = False
    c = c and d
    c = not c or d

## Exercise #3

What is the output generated by the following program?
Answer = $3.50

    d = 0
    for p in range(0, 5):
        if p % 4 == 0:
            d = d + (p-1) * 25;
        else:
            d = d + 100;
    print("$" + str(d//100) + "." + str(d % 100))

## Exercise #4

What is the output of the following code?

    def F1(i, j) :
        print(f"F1({i}, {j})")
        F2(j, i+j)
        print(f"F1: i = {i}, j = {j}")
        

    def F2(i, j) :
        print(f"    F2({i}, {j})".format(i, j))
        k = F3(i, j)
        print(f"    F2: i = {i}, j = {j}, k = {k}")
        

    def F3(i, j) :
        print(f"        F3({i}, {j})".format(i, j))
        i = i+j
        j = i+2*j
        k = 2*i+3*j
        print(f"        F3: i = {i}, j = {j}, k = {k}")
        return k
        

    print("Result:")
    F1(1, 1)
    print()
